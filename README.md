"Ecliptronix" is an interactive educational tool designed to enlighten people of all ages about eclipses and the wonders of space. Specifically, it provides an engaging platform for kids to explore the mechanics of eclipses, dispelling misconceptions and revealing the truth behind these celestial events. "Ecliptronix" is divided into three core sections: Learning, Gaming, and an Online Portal.

The wealth of data used in this project is courtesy of NASAâ€™s API (WMTS, TLE, NASA Images and Video Library etc), and the backend is powered by Flutter, ensuring a seamless user experience. We firmly believe that "Ecliptronix" will ignite the curiosity of young learners, providing them with a fantastic opportunity to delve into the mysteries of space and celestial events, ultimately enriching their understanding of the cosmos.
